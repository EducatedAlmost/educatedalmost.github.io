After reading it for over a decade, I've noticed a decline in the /Guardian's/ quality. I'm looking for another newspaper to read but, surprisingly, the prices of their competitors range wildly.

In the past I've really enjoyed /The Spectator/ and /Private Eye/. I would love to try the /Financial Times/, but at that price I'm more likely to pick /The Telegraph/.

* Newspapers

/Prices are per month./

| Guardian        | £0.00  |
| Indy            | *      |
| Financial Times | £53.00 |
| The Telegraph   | £12.99 |
| The Times       | £26.00 |

The Indy's subscription page wouldn't load for me.

* Magazines

/Prices are per month./

| New Statesman | ~£10   |
| Private Eye   | ~£3.00 |
| The Economist | £17.90 |
| The Spectator | £9.99  |

The New Statesman and Private Eye do not offer monthly subscriptions. Private Eye's online content is free, this is for print.
