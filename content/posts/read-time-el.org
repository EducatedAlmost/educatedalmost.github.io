For a short while I was recording educational videos and audiobooks from scripts written in Emacs. A key piece of information I needed but didn't have access to was the time it would take to read these when recording. Emacs does provide the useful ~count-words~ function, but there was no ~read-time~.

Reading speeds average around 5 words per second, dropping to 3 for careful speech, and rising above ten for speed readers.
