Event Sourcing
State isn&amp;#39;t stored. We rebuild it every time we need to query or do something to it. It has its drawbacks, but ut does allow us to do things that would be impossible otherwise. We can view out system&amp;#39;s history with new perspectives, or add in missed past events.</description></item><item><title>æ/Demesne</title><link>http://blog.almost.education/posts/demesne/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.almost.education/posts/demesne/</guid><description>You don&amp;#39;t understand a pattern until you can implement it — domain-driven design, CQRS, event sourcing.</description></item><item><title>æ/read-time.el</title><link>http://blog.almost.education/posts/read-time-el/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.almost.education/posts/read-time-el/</guid><description>An Emacs package that tells you how long it takes to read things.</description></item><item><title>dired-listing-switches and ls</title><link>http://blog.almost.education/posts/dired-listing-switches/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 19:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.almost.education/posts/dired-listing-switches/</guid><description>Have you ever been unsatisfied with the way that dired1 lists your files?

In a previous post, I explained how I set out to test the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon using a randomly chosen set of five topics which I would look out for to determine an average time until they were seen again.
Subconscious seeking?
