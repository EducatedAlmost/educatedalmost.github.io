Event Sourcing
State isn&amp;#39;t stored. We rebuild it every time we need to query or do something to it. It has its drawbacks, but ut does allow us to do things that would be impossible otherwise. We can view out system&amp;#39;s history with new perspectives, or add in missed past events.</description></item></channel></rss>
